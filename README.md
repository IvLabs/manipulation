# Manipulation 
Control a Robotic arm and perform tasks autonomously


 a manipulator is a device used to manipulate materials without direct physical contact by the operator. ... manipulators have the ability to reach in to tight spaces and remove workpieces.
 
 In this project we study the manipulator's

 # Forward Kinematics 


 # Inverse Kinematics 
   Inverse kinematics is about calculating the angles of joints (i.e. angles of the servo motors on a robotic arm) that will cause the end effector of a robotic arm (e.g. robotics gripper ) to reach some desired position (x, y, z) in 3D space.
