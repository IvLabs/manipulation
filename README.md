# Manipulation 
Control a Robotic arm and perform tasks autonomously


 a manipulator is a device used to manipulate materials without direct physical contact by the operator. ... manipulators have the ability to reach in to tight spaces and remove workpieces.
 
 In this project we study the manipulator's

 # Forward Kinematics 
   Forward kinematics is frequently used to calculate the position of end effector when we know the degree value of each joint, meanwhile inverse kinematics is used to compute the degree of each joint when we know the position of the end effector.
To calculate forward kinematic, we can use simple trigonometry or denavit hartenberg parameter or screw theory . In this example we are going to use simple trigonometry to calculate 3d forward kinematics for 3 DOF robotic arm.

 # Inverse Kinematics 
   Inverse kinematics is about calculating the angles of joints (i.e. angles of the servo motors on a robotic arm) that will cause the end effector of a robotic arm (e.g. robotics gripper ) to reach some desired position (x, y, z) in 3D space.
