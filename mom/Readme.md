## Date 22-10-2020
* Mentors gave information about Osama Khalid.
* Aim of this week: To watch lecture 1 & 2 in detail.
* Make notes.(hand written)
* https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS223A
* Mentors gave introduction about project and issue tab in github.

* Doubt 1 = why we perform  **Homogenization** ?
* Answer =  To make Further calculations  Simple
* Doubt 2 = How the inverse  Transformation Matrix Obtained ?
* Answer = By tracing  the reverse path , there may be any obstacles considering  that in transformation  components
* Continue  to next leactures

* Translation matrix is unit less
* rotation matrix's nine parmeters
* Parameters for representation of manipulator 
     - length og arm 
     - Joint angle
     - angles b/w axis ( not sure )
* There is not any velocity transformation matrix
* state space vector 
* There are 12 no. of ways to attend any oriantation using Eular angles as well as fixed angles method
* Rotation matrix about an axis 
* Parameter K ( which is vector ) in Equivalent angle axis representation
* Eulers Parameter , why we need that parameters  ?
      - To avoid singularity problem 
* The last Example using cosign angles 

* TO DO 
    - post the values of cosign angles on discord
    - find the sign convention for that angles
    - avoid confusion b/w XYZ and ZYX sequence
    - Slove Assignment
