## Date 22-10-2020
* Mentors gave information about Osama Khalid.
* Aim of this week: To watch lecture 1 & 2 in detail.
* Make notes.(hand written)
* https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS223A
* Mentors gave introduction about project and issue tab in github.


## Date 30-10-2020
* Doubt 1 = why we perform  **Homogenization** ?
* Answer =  To make Further calculations  Simple
* Doubt 2 = How the inverse  Transformation Matrix Obtained ?
* Answer = By tracing  the reverse path , there may be any obstacles considering  that in transformation  components
* Continue  to next leactures

* Translation matrix is unit less.
* Rotation matrix's nine parmeters.
* Parameters for representation of manipulator.
     - length of arm .
     - Joint angle.
     - Angles b/w axis ( not sure ).
* There is not any velocity transformation matrix.
* state space vector .
* There are 12 no. of ways to attend any oriantation using Eular angles as well as Fixed angles method.
* Rotation matrix about an axis.
* Parameter K ( which is vector ) in Equivalent angle axis representation.
* Eulers Parameter , why we need that parameters  ?
     - To avoid singularity problem .
* The last Example using cosine angles.
---
* TO DO .
    - post the values of cosine angles on discord.
    - find the sign convention for that angles.
    - avoid confusion b/w XYZ and ZYX sequence.
    - Slove Assignment.
    
 
## Date 22-11-2020
* Maintain proper DOC
* Have direct communication with mentors and teammates avoid any third party apps(like voltaire).
* After completion of khatib lectures we have to make PPT explaining things learned.
* Like rohan sir showed a pipeline we will also have to create similar pipeline for our project. 
* Doubt from previous meet (about end-effector angle) explained.
* Video shared further explaining [DH parameters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuB_7BkYNMk)

## Date 17-12-2020
* Target: 
    * Complete Oussama khatib lecture series and then start inverse kinematics( Lecture with vision can be excluded)
    * Simulation of 3R joint arm using python.
* Questions:
    1. Should we use CPP or python for simulation ?
    Conclusion: Will use cpp for final hardware implementation and python will be used as of now for 3R.
    2. Difference between simulation and animation?
    Conclusion: Animation is basically a dynamic graph kind of thing whereas in simulation realtime differential equations are solved to get future values.
* As we are free now our learning pace should increase.
